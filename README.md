# ERA5 grids into national and sub-national boundaries worldwide

## Introduction:

[ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5) provides hourly estimates of a large number of atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km. ERA5 includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.

I have converted temperature and potentially other weather variable grids to national and sub-national boundaries for use in several papers.

Available for download (see [Data](#Data) below) in [RDS](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/12/remember-to-use-the-rds-format/) (compact) or csv (large) format.

In Python it is [easy to load RDS files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40996175/loading-a-rds-file-in-pandas) and much more compact files than csvs too.

Work in progress by Robbie M Parks.

## Code

### Bash files:

01_netcdf_download.sh                   - Download netcdf files for ERA5 by day for chosen years\
02_grid_county_intersection_raster.sh   - Area-weighted averages for each unit in a country\
04_population_grid_summaries.sh         - For population-weighting up to national level from sub-unit values

### Actual processing functions:

01_extract_netcf/downloading_netcdf_files_uk_day_sep_era5_cdsapi.py - script to download lots of ERA5 files from server\
01_extract_netcf/extracting_netcdf_files_era5.R - Does the heavy lifting here averaging by political sub-units\
03_population_grid/population_grid_summary.R  - Find population weights based on gridded population of world
