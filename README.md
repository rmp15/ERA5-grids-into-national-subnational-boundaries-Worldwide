Input:

ERA5 daily values

Code (prog):

Bash files:

01_netcdf_download.sh                   - Download netcdf files for ERA5 by day for chosen years\
02_grid_county_intersection_raster.sh   - Area-weighted averages for each unit in a country\
04_population_grid_summaries.sh         - For population-weighting up to national level from sub-unit values

Actual processing functions:

01_extract_netcf/downloading_netcdf_files_uk_day_sep_era5_cdsapi.py - script to download lots of ERA5 files from server\
01_extract_netcf/extracting_netcdf_files_era5.R - Does the heavy lifting here averaging by political sub-units\
03_population_grid/population_grid_summary.R  - Find population weights based on gridded population of world

Output:

grid_county_intersection_raster - temperature values by sub-unit in each country
population_grid_summary         - population weights calculated for each country by sub-units
